Step-by-Step Guide
1. Install React and Create the Project
   Install Node.js and npm.

Run the following commands to create and set up your React app:

npx create-react-app powerpregnancy
cd powerpregnancy


Install React Router:
npm install react-router-dom

Install React Quill for the rich text editor:
npm install react-quill


3. Set Up Routing and Pages
   Set up basic routing in src/App.js using react-router-dom.

Create the following pages in the src/pages directory:

Home.js: Welcome page with a brief description of the app.
PregnancyTips.js: Page with a form to ask pregnancy-related questions.
Diet.js: Page to log diet information and get feedback.
MedicalConditions.js: Page for logging medical conditions (to be expanded later).
Journal.js: Rich text editor for journaling.
Create a reusable Navbar.js component and add links to navigate between the pages.

3. Diet Logging Form
   In Diet.js, add a form to capture the user's diet and display a basic feedback message.
4. Rich Text Editor for Journal
   Install react-quill and implement a rich text editor in Journal.js to allow users to write and save journal entries.
5. AI Question-Answer Simulation
   In PregnancyTips.js, create a form where users can input questions and receive simulated responses. This will later be connected to an AI backend.
   Future Steps
   Backend Integration: Connect the forms (diet logging, medical conditions, etc.) to a backend (e.g., using FastAPI or Spring Boot).
   AI Integration: Integrate real AI using services like OpenAI for answering user questions.
   Authentication: Add user authentication for secure access to journal and medical information.
   Styling: Apply a CSS framework like TailwindCSS or Material-UI for a better user interface.
